### What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting precise and clear instructions (prompts) to guide AI models like ChatGPT, MidJourney, or Gemini to produce better and more accurate results.

### Why is it Important?
- **Improves Output**: Clear prompts help AI understand tasks and deliver more relevant answers.
- **Unlocks AI Potential**: Structured prompts can guide AI to write, generate images, or code effectively.
- **Reduces Errors**: Helps avoid incorrect or vague responses by providing detailed instructions.

### Example
Initial Prompt: *"What is 923 * 99?"*  
AI Output: *Incorrect result due to lack of reasoning.*

Improved Prompt:  
*"What is 923 * 99? Break it down step by step."*  
AI Output: *Correct result with logical steps.*

### How to Get Better?
1. Add context and details to prompts.  
2. Use step-by-step instructions for logical tasks.  
3. Experiment and iterate on prompts for the best results.

### Key Takeaway
**A well-crafted prompt = Better AI output.** Practice refining prompts to maximize the potential of AI tools.
